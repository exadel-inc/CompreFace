## Overview

CompreFace is an application for facial recognition that can be integrated as a standalone server or deployed on the cloud and can be set up and used without machine learning expertise.
Our method is based on deep neural networks, which is one of the most popular facial recognition methods and provides a convenient API for model training and face recognition. We also provide an easy-to-understand roles system with which you can easily control who has access to the model.
Every user can create their own models and train them on different subsets of input data. 

## Feedback survey

We are constantly improving our product. But for better understanding which features we should add or improve we need your help!
Feedback form is totally anonymous, it will take just 2 minutes of your time to answer the questions:

## Features

The system can accurately identify people even when it is only given one example of their face.
CompreFace:
 - Uses open-source code and operates fully on-premises for data security 
 - Can be set up and used without machine learning expertise
 - Uses one of the most popular face recognition methods for highest accuracy 
 - Includes a UI panel with roles for access control
 - Starts quickly with one docker command

## Simple tutorial of usage

Step 1. You need to sign up to the system (First user in CompareFace admin has Owner role, but it is possible to change the role) and then LogIn with created account or just use the existing one. After that system redirects you to the main page.

Step 2. Create an application (left section) with "Create" link at the bottom of the page. An application is where you can create and manage your face collections.

Step 3. Enter you application with double click on the name of the application. Here you will have two possibilities. The first one is to add new users to your application and manage permissions ( Global Owner and Administrator roles already have access to any application without invite, user role doesn't.) The second one is to create face collections.

Step 4. After creating new collection, it appears at the Face Collections List created within the application with an appropriate name and API key. The user has the possibility to add new Face or to test the existing one (three dots on right side and click "test" link). This option will lead the user to Test Face Collection page, where is the drag&drop to upload image with face to recognize. We recommend an image size no higher than 5MB, as it could slow down the request process. Supported image formats are JPEG/PNG/JPG/ICO/BMP/GIF/TIF/TIFF format.

Step 5. Upload your photo and let Face Recognition system compare faces. When you have face contour detection enabled (green borders around the face). These points represent the shape of the feature. API requests within the solution use RESTful API, and backend data collection. [Read more about API](https://github.com/exadel-inc/CompreFace#rest-api-description) With Face Recognition system APIs you can add Face Recognition capabilities using simple API Calls.

The following result Json illustrates how these points map to a face, where

1. subject -person identificator
2. similarity - gives the confidence that this is the found subject
3. probability - gives the confidence that this is a face
4. x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max are coordinates of the face in the image

```

"result": [
{
  "box": {
    "probability": 0.99583,
    "x_max": 551,
    "y_max": 364,
    "x_min": 319,
    "y_min": 55
  },
  "faces": [
  {
    "similarity": 0.99593,
    "face_name": "lisan"
  }
  ]
}
]
```

The following JavaScript code example allows to add new face to Face Collection.

```

 async function saveNewImageToFaceCollection() {
  let name = encodeURIComponent('John');
  let formData = new FormData();
  let photo = document.getElementById("fileDropRef").files[0];

    formData.append("photo", photo);

    try {
       let r = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/faces/?subject=`${name}`', {method: "POST", body: formData});
     } catch(e) {
       console.log('Houston, we have a problem...:', e);
    }

 }

```

This function sends image to our server and shows result in text area:

```

function recognizeFace(input) {

  async function getData() {
    let response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recognize')
    let data = await response.json()
    return data
  };

  let result = Promise.resolve(response)
    result.then(data => {
    document.getElementById("result-textarea-request").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data);
  });
}

```

## How it works

**Finding a face** 

Detecting one or more faces in an image. Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNN) was used for face recognition.

**Posing and projecting faces** 

Normalization of all found faces with rotate, scale and shear. 

**Calculate embedding from faces**

Calculating embedding and classifying the face based on extracted features. We took CNN for face recognition and the last 3 fully connected layers were removed. As a result, - NN calculates embedding. 

**Use embedding for recognize/verify faces using embedding**

Recognizing the person in the photo. We calculate Euclidean distance using [Nd4j](https://javadoc.io/static/org.nd4j/nd4j-api/0.4-rc3.6/org/nd4j/linalg/factory/Nd4j.html) to determine the level of matching faces.
