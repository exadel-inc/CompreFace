## Overview

CompreFace is the application for face recognition that can be integrated as a standalone server or deployed on cloud, and can be set up and used without machine learning knowledge. 

We use one of the most popular face recognition methods based on [deep neural networks](#used-ml-papers-and-algorithms), and provide a convenient API for model training and face recognition. We also provide a convenient roles system with which you can easily control who has access to the model.

Every user can create several models trained on different subsets of people. 



## Features

The system shows sufficient accuracy even if only one example for each face is used.

CompreFace is:

- opensource code and fully on-premise (security of your data)
- can be set up and used without machine learning knowledge
- used one of the most popular face recognition methods with high accuracy face recognizing
- UI panel with roles for access control
- fast start with one docker command



## Getting started

To get started, perform the following steps:

1. install Docker
1. just run command:
`
docker-compose up --build
`
1. open http://localhost:8000/



## Simple tutorial of usage

1. Registration users in the app
1. Creating applications, models, inviting users
1. Integrating your app via API if need
1. Images uploading, training a model with your own images by using the API key
1. Send a new image to recognize the face on it.

## How it works

**Finding a face** 

Detecting one or more faces in an image. Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNN) was used for face recognition.

**Posing and projecting faces** 

Normalization of all found faces with rotate, scale and shear. 

**Calculate embedding from faces**

Calculating embedding and classifying the face based on extracted features. We took CNN for face recognition and the last 3 fully connected layers were removed. As a result, - NN calculates embedding. 

**Use embedding for training model/recognize face using embedding**

Recognizing the person in the photo. Haifengl/smile [LogisticRegression](http://haifengl.github.io/api/java/smile/classification/LogisticRegression.html) as a classifier was used.

## Rest API description

By using the created API key, the user can add an image as an example of the face, retrieve a list of saved images, recognize a face from the uploaded image, retrain the model, and delete all examples of the face by the name.



### Add an example of the face

Creates an example of the face by saving images. To train the system, you can add as many images as you want.

```http request
curl  -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/faces/?subject=<face_name>&retrain=<retrain_option>" \

-F file=@<local_file> \
-F det_prob_threshold=@<det_prob_threshold> \
-F retrain=@<retrain_option> \
```
