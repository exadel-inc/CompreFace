# Overview

CompreFace is a free and open-source face detection and recognition GitHub project. Essentially, it is a docker-based application that can be used as a standalone server or deployed in the cloud. You don’t need prior machine learning skills to set up and use CompreFace.

CompreFace provides REST API for face recognition, face verification, face detection, landmark detection, age, and gender recognition. The solution also features a role management system that allows you to easily control who has access to your Face Recognition Services.

CompreFace is delivered as a docker-compose config and supports different models that work on CPU and GPU. Our solution is based on state-of-the-art methods and libraries like FaceNet and InsightFace.

# Features

The system can accurately identify people even when it has only “seen” their photo once. Technology-wise, CompreFace has several advantages over similar free face recognition solutions. CompreFace:

- Supports many face recognition services: face identification, face verification, face detection, landmark detection, and age and 
gender recognition
- Supports both CPU and GPU and is easy to scale up
- Is open source and self-hosted, which gives you additional guarantees for data security
- Can be deployed either in the cloud or on premises
- Can be set up and used without machine learning expertise
- Uses FaceNet and InsightFace libraries, which use state-of-the-art face recognition methods
- Features a UI panel for convenient user roles and access management
- Starts quickly with just one docker command
